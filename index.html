        <p>The purpose of visual arts is to express and evoke feelings through the use of perceptible forms, such as painting, film-making, sculpting, and many others. The practice has been around since the Stone Age when the first examples of art were mere cave paintings and carvings. Over time, art evolved, and people began to express themselves through different styles and methods. Visual art is meant to resonate with a person by using core concepts such as color, subject, and shape in order to invoke certain feelings.The goal of our website is to inform people about the world of technology in visual art by showing the past creations of this topic and making our own hypothetical technological innovation.</p>
