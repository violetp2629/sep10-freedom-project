            <p>The purpose of visual arts is to express and evoke feelings through the use of perceptible forms, such as painting, film-making, sculpting, and many others. The practice has been around since the Stone Age when the first examples of art were mere cave paintings and carvings. Over time, art evolved, and people began to express themselves through different styles and methods. Visual art is meant to resonate with a person by using core concepts such as color, subject, and shape in order to invoke certain feelings.The goal of our website is to inform people about the world of technology in visual art by showing the past creations of this topic and making our own hypothetical technological innovation.</p>

<!--                    <p>This section details the possible ideas that we had for the future of visual arts. In order to create fast and efficient appliances that everyone has access to, we have created multiple technological innovations that we think could help with that. Not only would they improve performance, but they would also make the process of creating art easier.</p>-->
<!--                    <br>-->
<!--                    <p>Our main idea is to have an art device called VAV, where users can create basic scenes and then project the image in hologram form. The purpose of this device is to help with learning anatomy and animation. The user would create the scene on the device with the provided models such as people, animals, trees, and other objects. When the scene is done the device will be able to project the scene as a 3D hologram out of a port located on the back. While using the provided MOCAP gloves the user will be able to physically edit and change the hologram to their liking. The hologram can also be edited by manually using the device. VAV is relatively the same size as an Ipad and is lightweight, ensuring easy travel.</p>-->

There would also be a feature that allows the user to alter the drawing and change the type of brush used to create the line art.</li>-->
<!--                        <li>Another would be a pen that can pick up colors from the environment by touching different surfaces. An example of this would be making the pen touch a green leaf, then the pen will illustrate in green.</li>-->

                        Possible Tech Inventions and Ideas
                    </span>
                    
                    <p>This section details the possible ideas that we had for the future of visual arts. In order to create fast and efficient appliances that everyone has access to, we have created multiple technological innovations that we think could help with that. Not only would they improve performance, but they would also make the process of creating art easier.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Our main idea is to have an art device called VAV, where users can create basic scenes and then project the image in hologram form. The purpose of this device is to help with learning anatomy and animation. The user would create the scene on the device with the provided models such as people, animals, trees, and other objects. When the scene is done the device will be able to project the scene as a 3D hologram out of a port located on the back. While using the provided MOCAP gloves the user will be able to physically edit and change the hologram to their liking. The hologram can also be edited by manually using the device. VAV is relatively the same size as an Ipad and is lightweight, ensuring easy travel.</p>

                    <span class="italic text-lg">
                        Other smaller ideas:

                    <br>
                    
                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>A possible innovation would be an app that automates line art. The user would be able to upload their sketch to the app and it will instantly create line art for the sketch. There would also be a feature that allows the user to alter the drawing and change the type of brush used to create the line art.</li>
                        <li>Another would be a pen that can pick up colors from the environment by touching different surfaces. An example of this would be making the pen touch a green leaf, then the pen will illustrate in green.</li>
                        <li>MOCAP suits (motion capture/CGI suits) that have separable parts are also a possibility. The suit would be connected by zippers at the hands, feet, limbs, and other parts of the body so that if the user would want to reference the motion of the hand, they would just wear the hand.</li>

                    For this project my partner and I were tasked with using one “tool” of our choice to help create our webpage. After a long period of consideration, my partner and I decided that [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) would be the best choice to accomplish what we wanted to.

                            <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
